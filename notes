too much to write, re-watch videos if needed

mainpoints:
MAKE SURE YOUR FILES ARE IN THE RIGHT FOLDERS AND THE CODE HAS THE RIGHT FILE PATH
images go in the static folder
css goes in the static folder
index.html goes in the template folder

i can utilize website templates to cut down on work (html5up.net for templates and unsplashed for images)
document.body.contenteditable=true
^if using this, save the html data and replace otherwise it wont save
